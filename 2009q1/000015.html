<PRE>Hi,

I didn't see Thomas answering on these yet (just commiting your DSP TODO
list to Hatari repo), so I'll try to give my (possibly inaccurate) answers.

</I>&gt;<i> I've read on Atari.org that you want to improve the falcon emulation

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>
In general, yes.  See the Wikipedia article:
	<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_ST">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_ST</A>


&gt;<i> - Do all the pairing instructions coded for the St emulation still run
</I>&gt;<i> for the Falcon ?
</I>
Could differ...


&gt;<i> - In the Hatari menu, the Cpus are 68000, 68010, 68020, 68020+copro and
</I>&gt;<i> 68040), but no 68030. But the Falcon CPU is a 68030, no ?
</I>
Here's more info on the these:
<A HREF="http://www.freescale.com/files/archives/doc/ref_manual/M68000PRM.pdf">http://www.freescale.com/files/archives/doc/ref_manual/M68000PRM.pdf</A>

From Wikipedia:
&quot;Motorola mainly used even numbers for major revisions to the CPU core such 
as 68000, 68020, 68040 and 68060. The 68010 was a revised version of the 
68000 with minor modifications to the core, and likewise the 68030 was a 
revised 68020 with some more powerful features, none of them significant 
enough to classify as a major upgrade to the core.&quot;

AFAIK the main (only?) real difference between 020 and 030 is that 030 has
MMU.  Unless you try to run something like normal Linux (not uCLinux) or
MiNT with memory protection / virtual memory support, this shouldn't be an
issue.

Does anybody know a normal Falcon program/demo that would require an MMU?


&gt;<i> - Can we use hatari code to emulate an accurate falcon or will we have
</I>&gt;<i> to make a branch for the development (Atari and Falcon were not
</I>&gt;<i> completly compatible together).
</I>
Hatari already emulates Falcon and can switch between ST/STE/TT/Falcon
emulation at run-time (will of course reset the emulated system).

This is achieved by the hardware IO handlers tables in ioMemTab*.c files
(ioMemTabFalcon.c is naturally for Falcon) and other code checking the
nMachineType configuration option in following files:
dmaSnd.c
ioMem.c
options.c
psg.c
reset.c
screen.c
statusbar.c
stMemory.c
tos.c
video.c

The TT &amp; Falcon screen handling uses code from Aranym (which always does
fullscreen updates and supports also higher bitdepths than 4-bits), ST and
STE screen handling is based on greatly refactored code originally from
WinSTon (which usually updates only changed part of screen and has well
optimized support for the ST/E 1-4 bits planar modes).

Nicolas has had some thoughts of separating the video.c (which handles
the register stuff, overscan, fine scrolling etc) code for different
machines into completely different functions that are selected when machine
type is selected (instead of having machine type ifs in generic functions).

Falcon has of course also the DSP emulation. :-)
