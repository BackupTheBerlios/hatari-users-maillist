<PRE>Hello Thomas,

Another long mail, sorry :)
And sorry for the way I write the sentences, it looks like a catalog 
book sometimes, but I always ask me plenties of questions :)

1st point :
----------
I've tested numactl, it worked fine. But I don't know this tool. Are 
there parameters to use to &quot;simulate&quot; one CPU and 1 Go Ram computer ?

2nd point:
----------
I continue to search why there are still problems in the Host Interface 
(HI) module.
I'm pretty sure that most of our actual bugs are there. (Transferts and 
synchro problems).

I've catched the DSP code of &quot;Papa was a blade runner&quot;. It  contains few 
instructions , only  standard instructions (I haven't found &quot;strange&quot; 
instructions there. So I think again that the graphical problems comes 
from the HI).
I think it depends if there are few or many exchanges in a short time or 
alternance of read2DSP and write2DSP, ...

I'm pretty sure that the way I've recoded it is much better than before.
But it seems not suffisant for now.
The problem is that I try to synchronize the DSP and the CPU artificialy.
(I've included 4 while loops before DSP_Send, DSP_Receive,  Host_Send 
and Host_Receive).
 It seems that the test I use to go out of the while is not correct or 
not suffisant.

If we want to emulate a &quot;Real standard Falcon030&quot;, I think we'll have to 
run the DSP at exactly 32 Mhz, calculate the 
DSP_cycle_lenght_instruction and code also a &quot;real 8MHZ Host interface&quot;.

I can code the DSP_cycle_lenght_instruction for each instructions if you 
want. (I planed to do it, but I was not sure if it would be useful or not).

3rd point :
----------
I've read on Atari.org that you want to improve the falcon emulation 
part. I ask me a few questions about this :

- Are the Falcon blitter and the Ste blitter the same ?
- In general, are the componant all the same (Yamaha, ...)
- Do all the pairing instructions coded for the St emulation still run 
for the Falcon ?
- In the Hatari menu, the Cpus are 68000, 68010, 68020, 68020+copro and 
68040), but no 68030. But the Falcon CPU is a 68030, no ?
- Can we use hatari code to emulate an accurate falcon or will we have 
to make a branch for the development (Atari and Falcon were not 
completly compatible together).

4th point:
---------
I propose you a DSP TODO list (from my point of view) if we want an 
accurate Falcon emulator.
It can be completed by a Falcon TODO list.

In no order :

- Run the DSP at exactly 32 Mhz
- Calculate the real cpu time used by each instruction
- Code a real Host interface module (DMA mode, Interrupt mode, ...)
- Add all the interruptions into the DSP
- Add the Port C (SSI) functions
- Add a direct sound entrance (to be able to use programs like &quot;Audio 
Fun Machine&quot;)
- Add the sound matrix and connect the DSP to it
- Add direct 2 disk
-

5th and last point (for now :):
-----------------------------
The DSP known bugs:
- Problems into the Host interface (PortB) transferts
- A rendering bug into the mapping on the cube of &quot;Papa was a Blade 
Runner&quot; demo
- No floor and ceiling rendering in BadMood 2.14A
- No rendering at all into BadMood 3.07A
- problem into Des lazers et des hommes : when we move, the view jumps 
sometime to another angle of view
- Problem with all the programs that transfers data from/To DSP without 
checking first
- A bad gestion into overflow and Carry for ADD and SUB instructions

I can take some parts of this into development if needed.
I'll continue to investigate into the known bugs for now.

Regards,

Laurent
