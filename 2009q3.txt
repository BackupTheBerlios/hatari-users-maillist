Hi,

I like the window decorations too, but getting them is too much trouble
as Hatari screenshot functionality works now so nicely. :-)

If the program doesn't have anything on borders, I think the black borders
around the screenshot look bad.

Laurent's Falcon screenshots seem to be zoomed too.

I kind of like that too, it "proves" that the screenshot is from Hatari
similarly to window title/borders.  I just wonder whether I should somehow
try to fit Hatari version into the statusbar. :-)

For some reason imagemagick (with something like "-colors 255") doesn't make
the image file smaller.  Gimp works fine though as long as one sets
dithering to "none" when changing image to indexed mode.

Interlacing increases the image size slightly and the images are pretty
small anyway, so I don't think this is necessary.

(Falcon TC pictures could be jpegs which already should make them smaller.)

Subject: [hatari-users] BadMood 3.07a, PMdoom0.81
Message-ID: <4A815549.3010804@arkea.com>

Hello,

I've noticed a big speed improvement with badmood (3.07a) with the 
latest DSP / 68030 accuracy and DSP cycles count.
Do you feel this speed improvement too ?
For me, the comment in the compatibility list is no more good.
I'm waiting for your return here.

Also for BadMood, is the latest version (3.07a) runs the heretic level 
on a real Falcon or does it displays garbage as we have on the hatari 
version ?
(doom.wad file works correctly, but heretic.wad file doesn't work with 
the latest badMood version).

For PMDoom (the doom written by Patrice Mandin), I've never managed to 
let it run on hatari.
Did someone here managed to let it work ?

Regards,

Laurent

Fixed.

The latest one from here:
http://pagesperso-orange.fr/patrice.mandin/en/port-jeux.html

Is very slow but it works fine (with doom1 shareware wad).  It doesn't need
DSP, so it's usable (speedwise) for me when run with fast-forward.  Did you
try with 14Mb of RAM?

Same with Patrice's Heretic v0.24 from year 2000.  I guess latest one would
too.

Now that I added menu entries to all the interesting doc files etc, I think
it's especially newbie friendly.  :-)

Argh, I forgot to update that after adding the number base support
for Hatari.  It's fixed now.   Too late for release though, but as it's
Python, it doesn't need to be compiled, one can just get it from here:
  http://hg.berlios.de/repos/hatari/raw-file/tip/python-ui/debugui.py

While testing that, I noticed that the Python UI trace settings dialog was
also broken, that was trivial fix too:
	http://hg.berlios.de/repos/hatari/rev/e8ba0d2c79c9
:-/

Well, I actually would like somebody to do some UI design first, e.g. 
screenshot mockups in Gimp, UI mockups in Glade or just text describing
what information there should be and where in UI & how one would control
it from the UI.

It's hard to add features without a clear picture about how exactly their
users would like to use them.  I don't really use the debugger myself,
developing it itself is more interesting; the conditional breakpoints thing
was especially intriguing challenge (the remote API adds also its own
"challenges" but it may be possible to fix/extend it...).

Is there anybody on hatari-devel or hatari-users who would be interested to
put effort into what their "dream" Hatari debugger UI (for the current / new
internal Hatari debugger features) should look like? :-)

I've made an port for hatari in Macports.
http://svn.macports.org/repository/macports/trunk/dports/emulators/hatari/Portfile
As you probably notice, the CFLAGS is same as the one used in hatari.spec.
