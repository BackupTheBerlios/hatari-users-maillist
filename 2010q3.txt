Subject: [hatari-users] keyboard mapping
Message-ID: <1278396350.2969.39.camel@soest>

Hello Everybody,

thanks for providing hatari. It is great fun to do things the way I did
15 years ago. I recently spend a hole night with playing Rainer Duda's
Fu?ball-ST.

What I am missing: the key for the Backslash ('\') on my german
keyboard.

I found some documentation here:

	<http://hg.berlios.de/repos/hatari/raw-file/tip/doc/manual.html>

But I do not have the mentioned SDL_keysym.h on my system and the
explanation of using shortcuts to control the emulator itself (like
ALTGR+x to toggle normal speed/fast forward) and "normal" key mapping
(like Scroll Lock will emulate the ST's UNDO key) is somehow mixed up.

in my .hatari/hatari.cfg I found in the [Keyboard] section:

nKeymapType = 0
szMappingFileName =

But no explanation how such a MappingFile might look like and no info
what a KeymapType is.

I also noticed, that I can switch between "Symbolic" "Scancode" and
"From file" mapping in the emulators GUI.
But switching beween Symbolic and Scancode seems to have no effect and
the format of a mapping file is still not explaint.

thanks
Andreas

Here's one for SDL v1.3:
	http://www.libsdl.org/tmp/SDL-1.3-docs/SDL__keysym_8h-source.html

But it seems that the numerical values have moved in v1.3 to SDL_scancode.h:
	http://www.libsdl.org/tmp/SDL-1.3-docs/SDL__scancode_8h-source.html

They're included with the SDL development files.

(I'll update the manual on this + add the links.)

Sorry, I didn't understand this, could you explain more?

Here's the example coming with the Hatari sources:
http://hg.berlios.de/repos/hatari/raw-file/dabb65b541c9/doc/keymap-sample.txt

Attached is another one.  Lines starting with '#' are comments.


I think SDL sources include simple test programs that give pressed SDL key
values (on host) and I could dig up a program that gives Atari keycodes
(inside the emulation or on real Atari).  Using something like those can
help.

That's easiest to change from the UI.

It's explained in the manual keyboard dialog section:

Hi,

(I CC'ed hatari-users list in case there are Windows users who've
bumbed into this and could help.)

Thanks.  Interesting that you're using Finnish version of EmuTOS. :-)

This means that Atari and host mouse co-ordinates are slightly out of sync
with each other.  You can either:
- Move the mouse to *opposite* corner of the Hatari window as
  this will cause the co-ordinates to get better in sync,
- Enable mouse grabbing with AltGr+M shortcut, or
- Switch to fullscreen with F11

(Mouse is grabbed while in fullscreen.)


I'm not sure what could cause mouse to get out of sync in your case.
In Falcon emulation resolution switching could do that, but you were using
ST emulation.

Maybe your SDL isn't fully compatible with your Windows "Mouse movement
acceleration"?  Does something similar happen in other programs
(e.g. games[1]) that use:
- SDL library
- Run in window
- Show, but by default don't grab mouse

[1] I was going to suggest openttd (see openttd.org), but then noticed that
it doesn't use SDL on Windows...
