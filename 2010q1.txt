 Hi all!

I recently started to reflect the past months a little bit, and I have
to admit that I often do not have very much time for Hatari anymore ...
and alarmingly I often also lack the motivation to hack on Hatari when
I've got spare time. Beside my job becoming quite stressful from time
to time, I think I am also somewhat tired after all these years to only
work on Hatari - I just want to also hack on some projects, try other
programming languages ... or just do something that is not related to
computers at all.

However, I don't want that the Hatari project suffers from my poor
motivation, so I asked Nicolas whether he would like to become a Hatari
admin, too, and he kindly agreed!
As far as I can tell, Nicolas is a very skilled coder who knows both,
the ST internals and the Hatari source code very well, so I think he is
the best person for this job :-) So please welcome him as new admin and
support him as good as you supported me!

Concerning myself, I will certainly continue to read the mailing lists
and reply to the one or other mail and commit the one or other patch
(I still plan to finish that CMake build system...). But it might even
become more difficult to get a reply from me than it was already in the
past months. Sorry, but I just need a break, I hope you understand.

Anyway, have a lot of fun with Hatari,
 best regards,
  Thomas

Hello Thomas and Nicolas,

I just want to say I'm happy to read that Nicolas will continue to administrate Hatari's project. I love this project, it's really interesting.

Thomas, I just want to thank you a lot for all you've done. 
I've personally learned a lot about DSP and emulation coding in general with all of you.
Take fun in your new activities, and don't forget to help us from time to time. ;)

Atari one day, Atari Forever, (Hatari is a part of this)

Best regards, 

Laurent

PS: I wish we could meet all one day, this would be fun.

 Hello Pascaline

I am very sad to hear that. Sincere condolences. I have to admit that I
hardly knew him, but I know how hard it is to lose a person in the
family, so I wish you a lot of strength in this time of grief.

Hi,

Currently all new files on GEMDOS HDD emulated directories are created with
upper case names as that's how GEMDOS specifies them.

I though that I could change the created host system file names to be in
lower case.  Would anybody be against this?

	commited
Message-ID: <201001261514.33140.eerot@users.berlios.de>

Hi,

Now it's too late to complain about the patch not working on some
platform, I commited it, changes in it were overlapping with some other
things I was looking into...

The improvements are:

* convert host filename chars that are invalid in TOS to valid ones ('@')
  (main thing is that extra dots etc don't break TOS fileselector etc).
 
* cut file basename and extension separately to 8+3 size
  (gives more readable TOS filenames).

* support long host directory names in addition to filenames
  (earlier they might be visible in TOS, but files in them weren't).

* first try matching exact (non-casesensitive) name first,
  only if that fails, use a pattern for long names
  (fixes renaming name.prg to name.pr).

* get rid of glob() and use opendir()/readdir()/closedir() directly and
  TOS pattern matching instead (unlike TOS, glob() interprets
  [] as ranges).

If there are no "nay"s in about week, I'll apply this change
which removes the zoom low res option and replaces it with
user definable resolution doubling limit.

I'd like to check your patch, but I have no idea how to apply it  :)))) 

On my laptop most of Falcon's Demos (Desktop too) are anticlockwise rotated.
I assume that it happen because of to small native resolution 1200x800.
And it seems that your path can solve that issue

I really appreciate it If you can advise me how to do 'undiff'

Regards
Cyprian

Why did you change the word "zoom" into "doubling"?
"to double" means scaling by factor two, so this seems inapproriate for
a variable zooming function to me.

You need "patch" program.

First, gunzip winsize2.diff.gz (Windows extractors can also uncompress *.gz
files, gunzip isn't necessary).

Then in the hatari directory, do:
	patch -p1 < winsize2.diff
to apply the changes.

After testing, you can do:
	patch -p1 -R < winsize2.diff

to undo the changes.

While the Falcon code supports arbitrary integer scaling factors, as far as
I can see, it's never asked to use any other scaling factors than 1 & 2:
-               /* Ugly: 400x300 threshold is currently hard-coded. */
-               /* Should rather be selectable by the user! */
-               if (width && width <= 400)
-               {
-                       nScreenZoomX = (800/width);
-                       width *= nScreenZoomX;
-               }
-               if (height && height <= 300)
-               {
-                       nScreenZoomY = (550/height);
-                       height *= nScreenZoomY;
-               }

For screen to get more than doubled, the original width would need to
be < 267 pixels and height < 184 pixels which at least I've never seen...
And ST/STE resolutions are never zoomed more than double.

My current code explicitly doubles the size when needed.

I think it also makes the result of that option clearer, as it implies
an integer zooming factor (user doesn't wonder why the window wasn't
zoomed to the specified size).

You haven't seen a lot of Falcon demos yet, have you? ;-)
Try "Terrorize your soul" for example, it switches to 320x100 or so a
couple of times... that means nScreenZoomY has been set to 5 with the
old code, that's a lot more than simply doubling the resolution...

I see.  I guess I have been running it with zooming enabled. :-)

But is this the correct thing to do?  The screen aspect ratio is then
completely bogus.

(See my questions about ST-medres style stuff on Falcon in earlier mails.)

Subject: [hatari-users] Hatari windows binary (test needed)
Message-ID: <alpine.LMD.2.00.1002281308140.9325@pulsar.staff.proxad.net>


Hello,

I configured the necessary tools (mingw, ...) under my linux box to be 
able to build the windows binary without having to boot under windows.

I tested this .exe under wine, and for me it seems to run like the 
previous 1.3.1 build made by thomas.

Could some people running windows try this directly and report problems 
here ? (try the keyboard shortcuts, using a local windows directory as a 
hardrive, ...)

This was built with SDL 1.2.14, but will run with previous dll.

This build is based on the current devel version, so if you want to see 
what Hatari 1.4 will run, it could be a good way to test it.


Thomas, for the built you made :
  - did you enable --trace option ?
  - pressing alt+pause doesn't enter the debug mode but just pause hatari.
    do we need a console or something else to enable it ?
  - the release dir hatari-1.3.1_windows contained sdl.dll, but shouldn't
    we include zlib1.dll ? (it prevents running from wine for example and
    I don't know if it's always available under windows too)

Subject: [hatari-users] New Monitor/Window options dialog feedback?
Message-ID: <201003122016.10524.eerot@users.berlios.de>

Hi,

Before I update the Hatari manual screenshots and description in the Screen
dialog section for the new Monitor/Window options dialogs, I'd like you to
use them a bit and tell whether they work as you'd expect.

I'm mainly interested on comments on removal of the Zoom checkbox and
replacing it with the "Max doubled" option that gives you more control on
what size TT & Falcon resolutions come up.


For ST/e low-res it does only doubling, for Falcon and TT resolutions it
could zoom more if you give large enough resolution.  The zoom factor
is an integer and I though "doubling" in this case tells better the effect
of it.  If you disagree, feel free to propose something else as its
name. :-)

(Or give any other comments on the new dialogs...)
