Subject: [hatari-users] Hatari 1.5.0 is released
Message-ID: <4E24C82F.1020904@corp.free.fr>

Hello

after quite some time, a new version is now available.

As usual, you can get the sources or some Windows binaries from 
http://hatari.berlios.de/ or 
https://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=10436

(I will add some OS X binaries too if someone build them)

Here's a small changelog, there're too many changes to report, see the 
full release-notes.txt for more details :

- On STE, correctly shift display 8 pixels to the left when using 224 
bytes overscan (e.g. recent demos by DHS)
- Add support for spec512 mode in med res (fixes 'Best Part Of The 
Creation' in 'Punish Your Machine', 'HighRes Mode' demo by Paradox)
- Precisely emulate the number of frames per sec (eg 50.053 fps in PAL 
instead of the usual 50 Hz), required for correct video/audio sync under 
STE (e.g. More Or Less Zero by DHS)
- Sound improvements for STE, major rewrite of the DMA audio, precision 
should be really close to a real STE (e.g. HexTracker by Paulo Simoes)
- Improved precision in sound emulation, with nearly no rounding errors 
over successive VBL during many hours.
- By default mix 3 YM voices using a lookup table of values measured on 
real STF to improve digisound (e.g. Flashback demo by TCB)
- Alternative CPU core based on WinUAE for more accurate Falcon 
emulation, including 68030 timings, MMU, ...
- Improvements in DSP emulation.
- Various changes in the SDL GUI
- Many more functions in the built in debugger
- Atari program given as argument to Hatari will be automatically
   started after TOS boots
- Many more small fixes related to video, audio, ikbd, ...


Thanks to everyone for submitting code, ideas, reporting problems, 
providing help to test on real hardware !

Don't hesitate to try this new version and to report your results.

Have a happy summer with Hatari 1.5 :)


Nicolas

Wow, that's a release! Thanks a bunch!

Great news!

Unfortunately I've faced some issues with hatari_falcon.exe under Win XP. Attached you can find my configuration files.
STF mode works fine (hatari_STF.cfg), STE (hatari_STE.cfg) and STF with harddisk (hatari_STF_HDD.cfg) freeze Hatari, I see black window (Hatari v1.5.0 Not Responding).

HighRes Mode shows black screen under hatari.exe (I assume due to old cpu core)

Thanks

Regards
Cyprian

I would need to test this, but on the contrary HighRes mode by Paradox 
should only work with the old cpu core, not with the new/falcon one.

Hi All, 

someone from AtariArea forum has ported Hatari to Android. Project is one early stage but can boot TOS 4.0x

Subject: [hatari-users] Microwire emulation + Xmas 2004 problem ?
Message-ID: <40682817.7153977.1315468764680.JavaMail.root@mail-zstore-1-a.gicm.net>

Hi Nicolas,

The problem is that PendingInterruptCount can be much higher than 8 
cycles : if the timer occurs during a movem or a div, pendingCyclesOver 
will be much above 8 cycles, so "8 - microwire.pendingCyclesOver" 
becomes < 0 and I don't think CycInt_AddRelativeInterrupt will like it 
that much.


I think there's no problem, as I've taken this into account in the do/loop just before to take into account the BIG CYCLE EATERS instructions.

This do loop does as many shifts as needed in the cycle time + pending time used 
by the processor instruction.

At the end of this loop, 2 case :
- all shifts are done and there's no need to start a new interrupt
- there are still some shifts to do and the pending time is ALWAYS between 0 and 7
  So 8 cycles for the new shift minus the pending time of the latest 68000 instruction


Hope I've not misunderstood your remark.

Regards

Laurent
