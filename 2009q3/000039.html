<PRE>Hi,

Now that I added menu entries to all the interesting doc files etc, I think
it's especially newbie friendly.  :-)

</I>
Argh, I forgot to update that after adding the number base support
for Hatari.  It's fixed now.   Too late for release though, but as it's
Python, it doesn't need to be compiled, one can just get it from here:
  <A HREF="http://hg.berlios.de/repos/hatari/raw-file/tip/python-ui/debugui.py">http://hg.berlios.de/repos/hatari/raw-file/tip/python-ui/debugui.py</A>

While testing that, I noticed that the Python UI trace settings dialog was
also broken, that was trivial fix too:
	<A HREF="http://hg.berlios.de/repos/hatari/rev/e8ba0d2c79c9">http://hg.berlios.de/repos/hatari/rev/e8ba0d2c79c9</A>
:<i>-/
</I>

&gt;<i> well, I guess you will have to extend it for the new 
</I>&gt;<i> debugger features anyway ;-)
</I>
Well, I actually would like somebody to do some UI design first, e.g. 
screenshot mockups in Gimp, UI mockups in Glade or just text describing
what information there should be and where in UI &amp; how one would control
it from the UI.

It's hard to add features without a clear picture about how exactly their
users would like to use them.  I don't really use the debugger myself,
developing it itself is more interesting; the conditional breakpoints thing
was especially intriguing challenge (the remote API adds also its own
&quot;challenges&quot; but it may be possible to fix/extend it...).

Is there anybody on hatari-devel or hatari-users who would be interested to
put effort into what their &quot;dream&quot; Hatari debugger UI (for the current / new
internal Hatari debugger features) should look like? :-)


	- Eero
