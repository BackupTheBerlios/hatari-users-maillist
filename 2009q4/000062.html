<PRE>Hi,

</I>
Aha!  The files in the HDDriver ZIP package have invalid permissions
(000 instead of e.g. 644) and I had out of habit[1] set the files as
read-only (444).

After setting hddriver.prg as writable and re-configuring it with
hddrutil.app, having GEMDOS drives and (one) IDE drive works fine with
the demo.

-&gt; There seems to be a bug in hddrutil.app that it doesn't warn if
    the hddriver file is read only and modifying it fails.  You may want to
    fix that (along  with fixing the demo zip file contents file
   permissions).


Next issue is that only copying from the IDE drive works.  Not copying data
to the IDE drive.  TOS says &quot;The disk in drive E: is physically write 
protected&quot;.  However, when I checked the HDDriver (demo) options from
hddrutil.app, none of the disks are marked as write-protected.

The demo README tells about this limitation:
	Data can't be written to other partitions than C:

But it would be nicer if it would show up like that in the hddrutil.app too.
(And it would say something like &quot;This cannot be changed in the demo&quot;.)


So, the demo allows easily (but slowly) copying data from HDD image to
GEMDOS directories, but to do things in the other direction, one needs to
use the boot floppy method from my previous mail.  (I might use that when
testing how to get newer MiNT and toolchains working under Hatari.)



	- Eero

[1] As a rule, I don't want anything, neither Hatari nor programs running in
    it, messing with any other files except ones I explicitly set as
    writable.  99% of the SW works just fine with read-only files.
