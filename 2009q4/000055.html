<PRE>Hi,

On Friday 13 November 2009, Uwe Seimet wrote:

Hm.  So in practice one should be able to copy data from an IDE HD image
to an GEMDOS partition/directory?

Could you give a bit more detailed instructions on how to do that?
That may be something I could add to the manual.


&gt;<i> &gt; If you write instructions on using HDDriver with Hatari and send me an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; URL to the page, I'd be happy to add pointer to that www-page into
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hatari manual.

</I>
Sure.


&gt;<i> As far as I can tell the problem is caused by the Timer C data register
</I>&gt;<i> not counting down accurately. HDDRIVER relies on the value of this
</I>&gt;<i> register for the ACSI bus timing. If the timing is too fast HDDRIVER
</I>&gt;<i> writes the command block bytes too fast and hatari will not retrieve the
</I>&gt;<i> proper byte sequence from the emulated bus. At least this is what I think
</I>&gt;<i> happens after looking at the hatari ACSI debug output. On each run of
</I>&gt;<i> HDDRUTIL's ID check different command byte values are reported even
</I>&gt;<i> though the same commands are sent.
</I>
Nicolas, any comments on the timings?


&gt;<i> AHDI does not use a proper timing (that's one of the reasons why AHDI
</I>&gt;<i> does not work with some real drives), but not relying on a timer the way
</I>&gt;<i> HDDRIVER does is most likely an advantage for AHDI when running with
</I>&gt;<i> hatari.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Have you already thought of not only supporting an IDE master drive but
</I>&gt;<i> a slave drive as well? My impression was that the IDE emulation is
</I>&gt;<i> basically capable of also supporting an IDE slave. Maybe all that's
</I>&gt;<i> missing is a way to configure the additional drive image with hatari?
</I>
Thomas has added the HDD support but he's been lately busy with other
things than Hatari.  Maybe he'll have time to look at this at some point...

Or at least give enough pointers in case you're yourself interested in
looking into this and providing a patch. :-)
