<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> Aha!  The files in the HDDriver ZIP package have invalid permissions
</I>&gt;<i> (000 instead of e.g. 644) and I had out of habit[1] set the files as
</I>&gt;<i> read-only (444).
</I>
This is because the archive was created with STZIP on a FAT filesystem
with no permission support.
I have updated the demo archive by re-packaging it under Linux with
the correct permissions.
 
&gt;<i> -&gt; There seems to be a bug in hddrutil.app that it doesn't warn if
</I>&gt;<i>     the hddriver file is read only and modifying it fails.  You may want to
</I>&gt;<i>     fix that (along  with fixing the demo zip file contents file
</I>&gt;<i>    permissions).
</I>
I don't think there is anything wrong with HDDRUTIL. HDDRUTIL preserves
the permissions of the driver file that is configured. This works under
TOS, but with hatari the Fattrib() call does not seem to provide the
correct file permissions and when writing to the write-protected driver
file hatari does not seem to return a GEMDOS error code. This is
probably something you should check.
I think there is also something wrong with the way hatari handles file
timestamps. My Pure C compiler always compiles any file in a project,
not just the modified files as it does with real Atari hardware. And
when copying files under hatari with KOBOLD the copies do not have the
timestamps of the original files but have the current date as their
timestamp. This is also something where the behavior of hatari differs
from a real Atari. Maybe the GEMDOS drive code of hatari can be improved
with this respect.

&gt;<i> Next issue is that only copying from the IDE drive works.  Not copying data
</I>&gt;<i> to the IDE drive.  TOS says &quot;The disk in drive E: is physically write 
</I>&gt;<i> protected&quot;.  However, when I checked the HDDriver (demo) options from
</I>&gt;<i> hddrutil.app, none of the disks are marked as write-protected.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The demo README tells about this limitation:
</I>&gt;<i> 	Data can't be written to other partitions than C:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But it would be nicer if it would show up like that in the hddrutil.app too.
</I>&gt;<i> (And it would say something like &quot;This cannot be changed in the demo&quot;.)
</I>
Where do you think this should show up? The driver you are configuring
can reside on any drive, i.e. also on A:, B: or a drive not managed at
all by HDDRIVER. HDDRUTIL can only report general problems when writing
or modifying a file, but it cannot be specific and say that modifying
was impossible because the file was located on a drive that was write
protected because a demo version of HDDRIVER was used.

Best regards

Uwe
