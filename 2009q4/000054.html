<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> Good to hear, but it seems to work only for people who have purchased
</I>&gt;<i> the commercial version of HDDriver.  The demo version README says that
</I>&gt;<i> it supports only drive C:.
</I>
Yes, I was aware that my comment does not help those just using the demo
version, but it's probably useful for those using the full version.
By the way, the demo also supports other drives than C: but other drives
are read-only.

&gt;<i> If you write instructions on using HDDriver with Hatari and send me an URL
</I>&gt;<i> to the page, I'd be happy to add pointer to that www-page into Hatari
</I>&gt;<i> manual.
</I>
I am thinking of it, but first I want to try out some other things.

Maybe you are interested in why HDDRIVER can access emulated IDE drives
under hatari, but does not work with emulated ACSI drives.
As far as I can tell the problem is caused by the Timer C data register
not counting down accurately. HDDRIVER relies on the value of this 
register for the ACSI bus timing. If the timing is too fast HDDRIVER
writes the command block bytes too fast and hatari will not retrieve the
proper byte sequence from the emulated bus. At least this is what I think
happens after looking at the hatari ACSI debug output. On each run of
HDDRUTIL's ID check different command byte values are reported even
though the same commands are sent.
AHDI does not use a proper timing (that's one of the reasons why AHDI does
not work with some real drives), but not relying on a timer the way
HDDRIVER does is most likely an advantage for AHDI when running with
hatari.

Have you already thought of not only supporting an IDE master drive but
a slave drive as well? My impression was that the IDE emulation is
basically capable of also supporting an IDE slave. Maybe all that's
missing is a way to configure the additional drive image with hatari?

Best regards

Uwe
