<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> Doesn't work with the HDDriver demo.  It doesn't recognize the IDE in
</I>&gt;<i> addition to the GEMDOS drive C: it found.
</I>
I checked it with the demo and it works fine for me. And it should, since
except for not being able to write to all partitions and being slower
than the full version when reading data the demo is identical to the full
version.
Did you run TOS 3.0 in TT compatible mode, did you put the HDDRIVER.PRG
into the AUTO folder of C: and did you configure the HDDRIVER.PRG you put
into the AUTO folder with the &quot;Preserve existing partitions&quot; option?
(You might have configured a different HDDRIVER.PRG.)

&gt;<i> [1] Would it be OK for you if we provide such an image in Hatari www-site
</I>&gt;<i> with instructions on how people can copy data between first partition on HD
</I>&gt;<i> image and GEMDOS directory mounts?  (Instructions could have a link to your
</I>&gt;<i> HDDriver page in case people want to get rid of the demo limitations)
</I>
This is OK for me. But you should try to get it running with the demo as
I mentioned above, because this is really easy to use.

&gt;<i> Btw. HDDriver seems to panic EmuTOS.  Any idea why?
</I>
No, I can only confirm that EmuTOS panics with HDDRIVER and hatari.
Looks as if EmuTOS is missing something that is required from HDDRIVER's
perspective in order to behave like a real Atari, but I have no clue
what it might be. In general HDDRIVER is quite generic and as far as
possible tries not to rely on particular features of the underlying operating
system. This is, for instance, why the IDE port works with TOS 3.06, even
though a real TT does not have this port. In general HDDRIVER checks for
the existence/non-existence of several hardware addresses in order to
find out which bus is available. Non-existing hardware causes a bus
error, which is caught by HDDRIVER without crashing the system, but for
some reason this might not work with EmuTOS.

Best regards

Uwe
