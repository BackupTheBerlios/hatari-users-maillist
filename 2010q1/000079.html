<PRE>Thomas Huth a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i>  Hi all!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I recently started to reflect the past months a little bit, and I have
</I>&gt;<i> to admit that I often do not have very much time for Hatari anymore ...
</I>&gt;<i> and alarmingly I often also lack the motivation to hack on Hatari when
</I>&gt;<i> I've got spare time. Beside my job becoming quite stressful from time
</I>&gt;<i> to time, I think I am also somewhat tired after all these years to only
</I>&gt;<i> work on Hatari - I just want to also hack on some projects, try other
</I>&gt;<i> programming languages ... or just do something that is not related to
</I>&gt;<i> computers at all.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, I don't want that the Hatari project suffers from my poor
</I>&gt;<i> motivation, so I asked Nicolas whether he would like to become a Hatari
</I>&gt;<i> admin, too, and he kindly agreed!
</I>&gt;<i> As far as I can tell, Nicolas is a very skilled coder who knows both,
</I>&gt;<i> the ST internals and the Hatari source code very well, so I think he is
</I>&gt;<i> the best person for this job :-) So please welcome him as new admin and
</I>&gt;<i> support him as good as you supported me!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Concerning myself, I will certainly continue to read the mailing lists
</I>&gt;<i> and reply to the one or other mail and commit the one or other patch
</I>&gt;<i> (I still plan to finish that CMake build system...). But it might even
</I>&gt;<i> become more difficult to get a reply from me than it was already in the
</I>&gt;<i> past months. Sorry, but I just need a break, I hope you understand.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, have a lot of fun with Hatari,
</I>&gt;<i>  best regards,
</I>&gt;<i>   Thomas

</I>Hello everybody

I am the wife of S&#233;bastien ( Seb). I wanted to say to you that you do 
not have his news anymore because he regrettably died on November 23rd 
of this year from the consequences of a long disease. He fought bravely 
during 12 years it was a passionate person of the life, the computing, 
of atari . I am happy that he was able to share his passion with you.

Good continuation in all...

Pascaline ( his wife)
