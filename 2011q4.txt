Hi,

while trying to make some Falcon video recordings from Hatari, I've come 
across a problem. When the Falcon changes video mode, the Hatari window 
resizes, and so does the frame size of the recorded video. This makes it 
pretty hopeless to work with the recorded file afterwards.

Would it be possible to add a "padding" area of selected size? Eg, select 
that the video size should be 800x600, and the resulting screen render is 
centered to this buffer. It would make the recording useful also in Falcon 
mode.

Also I think this would be pretty good for non-recording sessions, as 
seeing the Hatari window change in size when running a game or demo is 
pretty ugly :)

Hello

I see what you mean and I agree it can produces bad results when 
recording video.
At the AVI level, it's not possible to have different x/y resolution in 
the same file, so the solution would be to have a larger screen where 
the atari's screen is centered.

It looks similar to the fullscreen mode when video/freq is not changed 
and we keep the same desktop resolution. Perhaps Eero could add this 
functionnality by extending the '--desktop' option ?

If one currently uses --desktop option and does recording in fullscreen,
does it already produce the desired result?

I.e. this is a request to have something similar also in windowed mode:
	--fixed-rez 800x480
?

Subject: [hatari-users] disk image filename not displayed after restoring a
	snapshot
Message-ID: <4E91DB41.9060302@corp.free.fr>

Hello

I noticed that if you press F12 and go into the floppy dialog after 
restoring a snapshot that contains an inserted disk, the filenames are 
not displayed in A: and B:

The filename is correctly saved/restored in floppy.c :

MemorySnapShot_Store(EmulationDrives[i].sFileName, 
sizeof(EmulationDrives[i].sFileName));

But it's not copied into ConfigureParams.DiskImage.szDiskFileName[Drive] 
and ConfigureParams.DiskImage.szDiskZipPath[Drive]

I don't think that calling Floppy_SetDiskFileName after restoring the 
snapshot, because it could auto insert disk B (which we don't want, 
because the user might have changed it before saving the snapshot).

Is it enough to update those 2 DiskImage's variable, or are there side 
effect to take into account ?
Anyone willing to provide a patch for this ?

Nicolas

No side-effects, but the floppy image might be inside a zip file
in which case you need to set also zip path.  Zip path comes
only from file selector.  It's used by:
	Floppy_InsertDiskIntoDrive() -> ZIP_ReadDisk()

When image filename is determined to be a ZIP archive.
Zip path tells the image file name within the ZIP archive.

Hi,

sorry about the delay, it's been one of those weeks at work.

Good idea about using the --desktop option, I hadn't thought of that.
It works and the resolution changes doesn't give different sized frames.

The slight problem is that I get a 1680x1050 resolution video dump (or 
bigger if I use an external screen) :-)

--fixed-rez 800x600 parameter sounds awesome, especially for windowed mode 
:)

Good.

I guess this is a problem because it slows down the Hatari saving and
files are larger + cropping / re-compressing the result in video editor
takes longer & more memory...

It will probably affect both fullscreen & video mode.  I.e.
which ever of the --fixed-rez or --desktop option is given
later, wins.

I'll take a look at that later (hopefully before year end, for
now I'm busy with AHCC & EmuTOS).  If you don't hear anything
from be by early next month, please remind. :-)

Hi

I added the disk image and zip path for drive A: and B: to the memory 
snapshot, no error seen while testing this.

I added an option to force the resolution to be fixed to
the given max resolution.  You can use it like this:
	--max-width 800 --max-height 600 --force-max yes

It affects both, unless --desktop option is enabled (like it's
by default), then desktop resolution will be used for fullscreen.

If it works fine for you and others don't have any objections
for the option & config names, I'll add docs for it.

Althought it's kind of nice also for other things than video
recording, I'm not planning on adding support for that to
the SDL UI.  (maybe to the Python/Gtk UI)

Message-ID: <20111201174658.258b2427@think43>


 Dear Hatari community,

as you all know, there has been an announcement end of September that
BerliOS is going to be shut down at the end of December 2011. While we
were evaluating alternatives, there was another announcement one month
later that BerliOS might continue, led by a non-profit association that
should be founded in November. So we decided to wait and see whether the
Hatari project could continue at BerliOS or not.

Well, November is now over, and there hasn't been another announcement
yet that the association has successfully been founded. Considering
that we might now have only one month left to move the project to
another host, and that we might need some weeks for a smooth
transition, we decided to move the Hatari project now.

Starting with today, Hatari will now be hosted on tuxfamily.org. Our
new homepage is http://hatari.tuxfamily.org/ - so please update your
bookmarks!
Information about downloading Hatari releases and about how to clone
the new Mercurial repository can be found here:

 http://hatari.tuxfamily.org/download.html

Of course we will also need a new mailing list since this list here at
BerliOS might not survive in 2012. Please visit the following page for
information about how to join the new mailing lists:

 http://hatari.tuxfamily.org/contact.html

Note that we most likely won't have a new bug tracking service at
tuxfamily.org, since this host does not provide this service by
default. The prefered way to report bugs is now to write a mail to one
of the new mailing lists. Considering that most of the bugs have already
been reported via mail (or atari-forum.com) in the past, this
restriction should not hurt too much.

Please have a look at the new website, test the new mercurial
repository, join the new mailing list(s) and if you hit a problem, get
in touch on this mailing list here or on the new ones if possible.

 Enjoy,
  Thomas

Hello

thanks for having worked on this.

Regarding the mailing list, as it's rather fast to switch to a new one 
(compared to setting a new homepage and source repository), maybe we can 
wait a little more before considering the lists on berlios should not be 
used anymore ?

There're some ongoing discussions on berlios ML with pending issues, so 
the longer we can keep them there, the better it will be IMHO.

Sure, we can keep this lists here at Berlios enabled as long as Berlios
survives, so that will be at least 'til end of december. But even if
Berlios then continues, I think it would be good to have everything at
the new host at one point in time, so I suggest to open new topics on
the new mailing lists instead, so we can easily completely move to that
host in 2012.

hatari-users on BerliOS has been *very* low volume, I wonder do
we need a separate users list on tuxfamily?

Maybe there should be separate mailing list(s) for bugs and hatari
releases instead?
